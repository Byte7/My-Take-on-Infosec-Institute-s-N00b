Writeup -

This level has a infinite loop in the JS script. 
So after disabling the JS Script for the page from the browser, we are redirected to another page where there is an image. 
Downloaded the image and since I suspected Steganography here , I used steghide to check and fair enough it was stegano image.
Used the following command to extract the text –
steghide extract –sf aliens.jpg
For passphrase, enter a blank pass phrase. 
The flag is extracted into a file called all.txt which is binary in data. 
Use any binary to text converter for converting the text into readable text.

The Flag is - infosec_flagis_stegaliens
