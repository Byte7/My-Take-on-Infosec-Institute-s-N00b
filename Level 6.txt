Writeup - 

The LEVEL 6 begins with us downloading a .pcap file which is to be analysed using the packet sniffer tool. 
I used wireshark for the same.Open the file using wireshark. 
Going through the captured packets we come across various captured packets of TCP and TLSv1 protocol packets. 
All these seem to be some packets that are not important to our cause.
We come across a packet of UDP protocol and things get interesting here. Note the .pcap file has only a single UDP packet.
The data in this packet is a HEX converted one ,so using an online Hex to ASCII convertor(Our flag being in readable format,hence ASCII numbers â€¦..), I got the flag.

The Flag is - infosec_flagis_sniffed
