Writeup - 

On Opening up level 8, We have to download a file named app.exe . 
This point me to figure that this challenge is of the reverse engineering type. 
But before going all out on reverse engineering with ollydbg,etc. ,since I have the identified the general pattern of the flags in this series of challenges as <infosec_flagis_XYZ>, I thought of searching the file for this particular string pattern using commands like strings and grep. 
The command is â€“ Strings app.exe | grep infosec_flagis
And sure enough, I get the flag.

The Flag is - infosec_flagis_0x1a
