Writeup -

We have a PHP labelled image for the 11th level below the Smeagol gif from the last level.
Download the php image. I started with the string command coupled with grep as –
Strings php-logo-virus.jpg|grep infosec_flagis
The flag is the encoded string after the infosec_flagis_<this is the flag>.
Decode the flag using terminal or hackbar addon to get the flag.
I get a link as http://www.rollerski.co.uk/imagesb/powerslide_logo_large.gif

The Flag is – infosec_flagis_POWERSLIDE
