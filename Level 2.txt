A quick look at the page hits me with two things ---
1.The file  is not present in the folder.
2.If the file is present, its not an image file. 

A look through the source code and clicking on the file reveals that the file is present.Hence, that leaves us with option two.
We can download the file by going through the file structure of the site.Type the link in browser and hit Ctrl + S to save the image.
The link is – 
http://ctf.infosecinstitute.com/img/leveltwo.jpeg

Use the file command to find out the type of the file.
File leveltwo.jpeg
Got the result as – ASCII text

Use the cat command to see the contents – 
The flag seems to be encrypted with alphanumeric so I suspect a base64 encryption

Decode it using terminal as –
echo 'aW5mb3NlY19mbGFnaXNfd2VhcmVqdXN0c3RhcnRpbmc=' | base64 --decode

The Flag is - infosec_flagis_wearejuststarting
