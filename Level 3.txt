Writeup -

A QR code is given with a progress bar under it.
A look of few seconds gives the clue that progress bar is not going on to 100%.
So a quick look at the source code reveals that it is hardwired to be at 90%.So, mostly a distraction I guess.

Now moving the QR code, the QR code is decoded using an online QR code decoder. I googled for QR for decoder and found this one –

The parsed result of dots and dash give us the idea of the famous morse code.
I decoded the morse code using an online morse code decoder here –

The decoded morse code gives the flag.

The Flag is - INFOSECFLAGISMORSING
