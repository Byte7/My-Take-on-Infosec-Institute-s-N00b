The 9th level has the login page.The username and password fields means that a password cracking type problem.
Before using Jack the Ripper or even brute forcing for password, always check out first for the default passwords.
I googled for cisco ids default passwords and was given the default username and password by various sites. 
After going through the list of username and passwords, I tried out the classic combination of “root + attack” as “username+password”…..
And Voila!!!!! I got the flag. 
A close look at the flag reveals it is mirrored.
So, fireup another tab and google mirroring text sites, put it in text box and you get the flag.
Or if you don’t want to do that, then simply see the text and read it backwards…..easy enough...

The Flag is - infosec_flagis_defaultpass
