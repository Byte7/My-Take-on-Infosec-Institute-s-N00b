The level begins with the some lines at the page. 
Now, after solving previous challenges, I have observed the level url have endings as “level<levelnumber>.php”.
But in this case this has 404.php. I tried accessing the levelseven.php page and was greeted by a blank window.
So, while  going through the page source, I got struck with the idea of cookies which yielded no result.
This led me to the idea of proxy. 
The addon of web developer toolbar helped here and by selecting options as follows I got the response headers for the levelseven.php page –
Information ----> View Response Headers
I am greeted with -----> response headers for level seven page.
The last line is familiar from earlier challenge and is a base64 encoding. 
Decode the line either using terminal using echo command or let hackbar addon do it for you.
