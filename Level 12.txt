The pic is the same from level one. So, this means that we have to go through the source code for the page. 
A quick look on the html code gives no clue or anything as I don’t see any encoded message in the code.
Then, moving onto the CSS files, I first looked up in custom.css file. It’s usual CSS styling elements. 
Second file is the design.css file. Opening this file gives – a class named as thisloveis.
There is a single color property in it.But the text is not specified for color.

The Flag is - infosec_flagis_heyimnotacolor
